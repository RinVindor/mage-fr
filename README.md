MANUAL INSTALL: https://github.com/RinVindor/mage-fr/releases/latest/download/system.json

## ⚠ This is still a beta release and should be reserved for testing purposes only !
## ⚠ No migration script will be implemented until V1 !
## ⚠ Any created actor/item might stop behaving correctly with any update !

## At this point (v0.22 something) I'm still halfway between prototype 2 and 3 but I'm confortable enough to release a beta version for testing purposes.
